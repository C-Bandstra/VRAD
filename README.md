# VRAD (Vacation Rentals Around Denver)

## Abstract 
VRAD (Vacation Rentals Around Denver) was a paired project (two people) given to us during the third quarter of our time at Turing School of Software & Design. VRAD is an online application where a user can log on and see different rental listings for vacation or business in different areas of Denver. The application begins with a login screen, where a user must enter in their name and email, and also their goal for using the application (vacation, business, or other). After logging in, the user is presented with a screen showing four different neighborhoods in Denver, along with a short description of each neighborhood. Once the user has selected an area, they will be able to see each of the available listings, showing the name of the property, a single photo, and an option to expand for further details. Upon expansion, the user can see all photos of the listing, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, the address, the cost per night, unique features, and gives the user an option to "favorite" that listing. After favoriting a number of listings, the user is also able to see all of their favorite listings on one screen. The overall technical objectives of this project were to get better-acquainted with the principles of React (considering this was our second project utilizing React), implement robust testing of each component, and utilize the Fetch API to retrieve the data from an external server. 

## Specific Objectives
1. Write squeaky clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax.
2. Make informed design decisions to create a user-friendly application.
3. Keep state based components to a minimum and leverage more functional components.
4. Use a modular architecture for your application file structure.
5. Think deeply about React Lifecycle Methods.
6. Become familiar with promises, nested fetch requests, and handling the UI based on acceptance of data.
7. Become familiar with routing and how to handle dynamic routes.
8. Use propTypes for every component receiving props.
9. Write tests for React components and some asynchronous functionality.
